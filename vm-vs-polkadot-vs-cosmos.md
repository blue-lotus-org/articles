### Comparison between 'Virtual Machines (VM)', 'Polkadot Parachains', and 'Cosmos':

#### Virtual Machines (VM):
- A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
- VMs provide a high level of isolation and security between different applications or operating systems running on the same physical hardware.
- Each VM has its own virtualized hardware resources, including CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces.
- VMs can be easily migrated or replicated across different physical machines.
- Popular VM technologies include VMware, Hyper-V, and KVM.

#### Polkadot Parachains [[A]](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-comparisons-cosmos):
- Polkadot is a multi-chain platform that allows different blockchains, called parachains, to interoperate with each other.
- Parachains in Polkadot rely on the relay chain for security, creating a shared security model.
- Each parachain has its own state transition function (STF) and can submit blocks to the relay chain for validation and finalization.
- Parachains share state with the entire system, meaning a reorganization of one parachain would require a reorganization of all parachains and the relay chain.
- Polkadot uses a hybrid consensus protocol with two sub-protocols: BABE for block production and GRANDPA for finalizing chains.

#### Cosmos [[B]](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-comparisons-cosmos):
- Cosmos is a network of interconnected blockchains, called zones, that communicate with each other through a main chain called the Hub.
- Each zone in Cosmos maintains its own state and has its own validator community.
- Zones in Cosmos can send messages and tokens to each other using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.
- Zones in Cosmos do not share state, so a reorganization of one zone does not affect other zones.
- Cosmos uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which provides instant finality.
