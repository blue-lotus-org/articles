# B2B - B2C
**B2B** stands for **business-to-business** while **B2C** is **business-to-consumer**. B2B ecommerce utilises online platforms to sell products or services to other businesses. B2C ecommerce targets personal consumers. A company that sells office furniture, software, or paper to other businesses would be an example of a B2B company. In contrast, a company that sells clothing, books, or electronics to individual consumers would be an example of a B2C company1.

The main difference between **B2B** and **B2C** is the audience or niche market for your marketing activities. B2B buyers have to consult with multiple departments before purchasing, while B2C consumers only have to consider themselves. B2B buyers look at the long term, which means they spend more time researching and sourcing recommendations. The B2C customer is more prone to impulse buying or emotionally driven purchases2.

B2B ecommerce tends to be more complex than B2C ecommerce. It involves heavier research, more needs-based purchasing, and less marketing-driven buying. Many B2B buyers have very tight parameters around the purchases they can make. This means that traditional revenue drivers like add-ons don’t have the same impact. B2B organisations didn’t have much of an incentive to optimise their customer journey but this is changing in the current climate2.

## B2B - SaaS (Software as a Service)
**B2B SaaS (Software as a Service)** solutions refer to software applications that are designed to serve the needs of business-to-business (B2B) customers through a cloud-based subscription model. In other words, **B2B SaaS solutions** are software tools that are developed and sold to other businesses, rather than to individual consumers.

These solutions are hosted in the **cloud**, which means that customers can access and use them over the internet, without having to install or maintain any software on their own computers or servers. **B2B SaaS solutions** can be used for a wide range of business functions, such as accounting, human resources, project management, customer relationship management, and more.

The **subscription-based pricing model** of **B2B SaaS solutions** allows businesses to pay for only the services they use, rather than investing in costly and complex on-premise software solutions. This makes **B2B SaaS solutions** a more affordable and flexible option for businesses of all sizes, particularly for those that are looking to scale quickly and efficiently.

## B2C - (Business-to-Consumer)
**B2C (Business-to-Consumer)** apps and consumer internet startups are businesses that offer products or services directly to individual consumers via the internet. These companies typically operate in industries such as e-commerce, social media, entertainment, and communication.

**B2C** apps and consumer internet startups can take many different forms, such as mobile apps, web-based platforms, or online marketplaces. The products or services they offer can range from physical goods, such as clothing or electronics, to digital products, such as music or video games.

These companies generally rely on a large customer base to generate revenue, and often use various marketing and advertising strategies to acquire and retain customers. They may also utilize data analytics and user feedback to improve their products or services and better meet the needs and preferences of their customers.

**B2C** apps and consumer internet startups have become increasingly popular and successful in recent years, due in part to the widespread adoption of smartphones and other mobile devices, as well as the growing importance of e-commerce and digital communication in people's daily lives.
